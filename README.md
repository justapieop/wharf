A collection of docker compose files for development environment.

# Disclaimer

As said above, these configuration files should only be used on development environment only. If you want to use on live production environment, you have to change predefined passwords and further config the server in order for it to work as intended.

I am not responsible for all the damages causes by misconfiguration of my compose files.
